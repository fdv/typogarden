Lush - a sophisticated Typo Theme

Lush is an ultra advanced theme for Typo for bloggers who want everything
without any difficult technical stuff involved. Drop it in, enable it and
you'll be rolling with a feature packed Typo weblog.

Lush is easy to install and easy to use! Almost everything has been
taken care of. Here are some small pointers to keep in mind when
using this theme. At the bottom of this document you'll find a full list
of distinctive features for this theme.

* Copyright / License

This theme is copyright 2005 by Marco van Hylckama Vlieg.
It's licensed under the Creative Commons By-NC license. This means you're
allowed to do with it whatever you want including porting it to other
weblog engines and / or (re)using the graphics or styles in your own
projects for non-commercial purposes. For commercial use please contact
me at marco@i-marco.nl and we'll work it out. 
In case you use the whole theme on your site or port it to another
weblog system you're kindly requested to leave the link to my weblog
which is located at the very bottom of each page intact. I worked for over
100 hours on this theme which means it represents a $5000+ value. It's
my gift to the Typo community but a link to my site would be really nice.

* Customization

Use lush_headers.psd to customize your header graphics with ease.
The layer titles are self explanatory. Save the header graphics in two
parts. There's a guideline in the document that tells you where to cut
them in half. The large part should replace lush/images/headback.gif and
the small part should replace lush/images/sideback.gif.
If you need help feel free to mail me! (marco@i-marco.nl)

* Trunk based

IMPORTANT:

This theme has been developed on Trunk versions of Typo. It may not work
on 2.6.0 or earlier versions due to differences in the templates used.
Installing a trunk version of Typo is easy. Check the Typo website for
information. The theme was developed on Trunk rev. 747 - 760. All these
are working. I can't predict whether something will break in future versions.
Let's hope not!

* Browser support

This theme has been tested and tuned for a plethora of browsers. It even
works fine visually in Internet Explorer 5.0. In terms of functionality
it works in Internet Explorer 5.5 and up. The theme has been tested on Firefox,
Internet Explorer 6, Safari, Omniweb and Opera 8.5+. IE for Mac is broken
unfortunately. It crashes on the Javascript that comes with Typo.


* Flickr

The Flickr sidebar plugin is fully supported and styled to match the
rest of the theme. You're advised to use square flickr images because
it looks much nicer.

* Features

This theme has a lot of features that set it apart from the majority of
free weblog templates:

- 100% custom design. Every pixel was designed especially for this
  theme. That means all graphics are unique.
- extensive browser support including IE5/5.5's broken box model
- Special graphical notice for users of IE5/5.5 encouraging them to
  upgrade their browser. It's only visible when using one of these browsers.
- alternating comment styles and admin comment styles
- alternating trackback styles
- print stylesheet for perfect article printing
- customized live search
- customized table-less comment form
- customized master archive page
- customized tags page
- customized categories page
- various script.acio.us visual effect enhancements
- adjustable font size for improved readability
- full gravatar support including a fallback default gravatar
  that fits with the theme
- XHTML 1.0 Strict 
- All current (nov 2005) sidebar plugins tested and supported
- A nice easter egg

This theme is dedicated to my lovely girlfriend Renie who had to bear with
me tweaking and tinkering with this theme every night and weekends for a whole month.
