### Fundamental

By [Martin Wulffeld][1]

This theme is meant to take advantage of the entire browser real estate available to it by making the sidebar utilize the remaining width. This makes it an especially interesting theme for blogs which have lots of content in the sidebar that expands horizontally.

The theme is also extremely light on graphics making dial-up users happy-happy.
