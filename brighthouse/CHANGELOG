1.2.2

- Overrode the live_search.rhtml in the theme directory instead of 
  requiring people to overwrite the one in the typo codebase
- Made the right sidebar absolutely positioned so that text overflows 
  in the content area (like from long text in <pre> tags) wouldn't
  wrap the sidebar to the bottom in IE
- Made the footer only span the content pane since the layout is no l
  onger floated
- Styled the older pages links at the bottom
- Styled static pages to have the same headers as blog posts

1.2.1

- Ummmm I don't remember :)

1.2.0

- Edit/Nuke links on comments and articles are no longer placed inline 
  (was pushing down the comments when you moused over, very annoying).
- Moved about-box out of the template so that its an optional static 
  sidebar element.
- Made the gigantor textarea for comments smaller.
- Restyled live search.
- Removed rico_corner.js as all rounding is being done now through CSS 
  background images.

* Compatible with FF 1.0+, Safari 10.4 and IE 6
